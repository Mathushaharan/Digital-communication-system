# Digital-communication-system

This project consist of two seperate MATLAB simulation files and the required audio and text files. First file (simulation_files_audio transmission) has the codes 
for digital communication system that can transmit an audio signal and receive it at the receiving end with less distortions and noise. The second files 
(Text) has the codes for transmitting and receiving a Text block without any errors.  

Source encoding method: Lempel-Ziv
Channel encoding method: Hamming code
